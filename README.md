# Class Activity 08A

This class activity is intended to demonstrate:
- How to collect some basic execution time information in both a Jupyter notebook (using the magic `%%timeit`) and in a standard Python file (using the `time` module).
- The comparative costs of various manipulations in Python lists and dequeues.

You can use this repository in one of two ways:
- You can clone it directly using the standard Git procedure.  In that case you **will not** be able to push your edits back up to this repository (you only have read access to this repository).
- You can copy this repository as a template in to your own GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Using your own copy you can then push and pull as much as you like.  (We recommend that you make your own copy private so that other students won't confuse your repository with this one.)
